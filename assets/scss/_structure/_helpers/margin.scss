/*	Margins
	======= */

/*	For maximum flexibility, we should be able to specify when we want this padding to apply. On the Congrats homepage, for instance, there's a row with very large padding that looks good at desktop, but not good at all at mobile. I could just modify that particular row's padding with a media query, but the idea here is to design as generically as possible: solve something now so we don't have to rewrite it later.
	
	I'm using the same notation I'm using for grids.
	
	Why mixins? Ordinarily I'd use an @extend, but @extends can't be used inside media queries. So rather than repeat everything manually, I set it up as a mixin.
	
	Eesh - the following is very repetitive. The ideal way to do this would have been to iterate across a set of lists and generate it, but just laying it all out here will be faster and clearer for now.
