Sections
========

This folder is outside the natural order of things. It contains styling for certain, specific sections such as FAQs and customized homepages. Congrats uses a homepage design that is not shared by the other sites - it's specific to that one site, so I'm putting it here for now.

My goal, as stated in the description, is to build things generically - individual sites and sections should have as little custom styling as possible. At some point, I'm going to fold the styling in this folder into the larger structure.



This is a little similar to the "other" or "overrides" layer in Harry Roberts's ITCSS - it's a catch-all for stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere. We may need this from time to time, but I'd like to minimize the extent to which we use it.
